# Football-Market


•	Our IDS project is about the top 250 football transfers that have taken place each year from the 2005-2006 season to the 2018-2019 season.

•	So basically football players have contracts with the team they play for. After the contract expires the player can either sign a new contract or  move to a team that is willing to pay his transfer fee mentioned in the contract.

The data set contains 3330 rows and 10 columns

•	The variables in the dataset are :-
1.	Name of the player
2.	Age of the player
3.	Team from which the player is transferring
4.	Team to which player is transferring
5.	The league to which he is transferring
6.	The season when he got transferred
7.	Market value of the player
8.	Transfer fee paid for the player (need not be equal to market value)


•	We will be plotting the market value of players with other variables (like age , position they play etc)  to see the trends in the market value.

•	We will also try to predict to what range the market value of the player in the next season.

•	We came across this dataset in www.kaggle.com
